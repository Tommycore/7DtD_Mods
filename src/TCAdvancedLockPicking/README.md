This modlet is meant to turn dungeon style PoIs back into nonlinear explorable places. You can pick any locked door but you better be careful: Failing to pick a lock might trigger an alarm that garners unwelcome attention.

# Features
- 5 Tiers of lockpicks, from bobby pins to pentest kits. Higher tiers shorten picking time and have a lower chance to break. They will also lower the chance to cause an alarm, once that's implemented.

# Planned features
- Recipes for lockpicks
- Move loot containers to the same system as doors
- Expand Lockpicking perk
- Alarm system
- Refactoring PoIs in a way that loot isn't concentrated in a single room, but rather spread throughout the PoI
